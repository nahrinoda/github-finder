### GitHub Finder

Using javascript and github API, i built this github profil finder application showing the user's latest 5 repos.
Simply, fill in the username and the app will fetch the profile that matches the username that you filled in. In case if there was no matching username, an alert will show for 3 seconds, stating that the user is not found.
